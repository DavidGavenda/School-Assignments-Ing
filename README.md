## A graduate of the master's program in Applied Computer Science:

Graduates of the Applied Computer Science program will acquire the ability to specify, design, implement, and maintain extensive modern software applications for both standard and specialized computer resources. They will be capable of extending the functionality of modern information technology systems, developing, customizing, and implementing modern information technologies in a selected application domain. Applied Computer Science graduates can work effectively as individuals, as members, and as leaders of development teams. They will gain knowledge and insights into areas such as big data, mobile computing, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and information system security.

In the application domain of Information System Security (ISS), graduates will gain both general and practical knowledge in the field of cryptographic algorithms, information security, secure communication protocols, electronic banking, PKI (public-key infrastructure), biometrics, and machine learning. Employment opportunities for graduates are predominantly in the areas of information systems security and auditing, electronic banking and commerce, cryptographic protection in public administration and special services, implementation and operation of electronic signatures, and the protection of sensitive data.

Graduates of the Modeling and Simulation of Event Systems (MSES) application domain will become familiar with advanced means of specifying information systems, with the UML modeling language, and with formal tools for describing the behavior of event systems, such as Petri nets, StateChart formalisms, and Message Sequence Charts, rewriting logic, or process algebras. They will understand specific phenomena of distributed event systems, especially phenomena such as component communication, interaction, independence, and parallelism, causality, and synchronicity of activities and events in distributed systems. They will be able to apply the acquired knowledge in the design, modeling, and analysis of event systems, in the application area of enterprise system management, workflow processes. They will be capable of developing applications for mobile platforms. Employment opportunities for graduates are primarily in the design of complex distributed information and communication systems and in the area of process modeling and auditing in companies and institutions, but also in the modeling and simulation of production and embedded systems.
